                        <p> FridgeMinder is a trio of devices designed to transform how users manage food in
                            their kitchens, with an emphasis on avoiding food waste. Our trio includes a magnetized
                            fridge-front touch-screen, a camera for the inside of the refrigerator, and a mobile
                            application. We developed FridgeMinder, a high-tech, user-friendly solution to be
                            compatible with any refrigerator.

                            We provide a comprehensive solution to help users prevent food waste.
                            Our product empowers users to avoid food waste by helping them not overbuy
                            while shopping, using our app’s on-the-go fridge camera access or inventory
                            of their items with expiration dates. The fridge-front touch-screen allows
                            users at home to review the contents and expiry dates of their items without
                            having to scour their refrigerator and examine each item. Best of all, this
                            solution is 100% portable, allowing users to pay once and enjoy it in every
                            dorm, apartment, and home they move into.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the start of the project we mainly wanted our targeted users to be college
                            students and did conduct initial semi structured interviews with them revealing
                            that the biggest issue was food waste due to them forgetting about food they had
                            or simply because they were too busy to cook or use up their ingredients. After
                            receiving feedback from industry professionals we learned that the device was not
                            the best for college students as they might not waste money on an expensive device.
                            This is why we pivoted the idea to be more universal not only for college students
                            but for every stage of life and no matter the fridge size.

                            We wanted to focus on how our device can tailor into a younger demographic's

                        <p>
                            Our mid-fidelity prototype used simple strokes in designing
                            buttons and a clean font style. We introduced some colors to
                            improve the accessibility for our main functionality. This desire
                            to keep our design simple allowed us to collect valuable feedback
                            during user testing.
                        </p>

                        <b> Design Decision and teamwork conflict ⚠️: </b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although it is not very common for mid fidelity prototypes to contain colors,
                            our team wanted to improve users' understanding of the prototype for the user
                            testing step. Our team had a disagreement in this step as we were divided on
                            having color. Some of the team argued against color as it would detract from us from
                            diving deeply into user pain points by wasting unnecessary time in choosing an
                            appropriate color. The other side of the team wanted to add color in order to create
                            a more visually appealing app that would let users differentiate different elements.
                            In the end after discussion with external sources (professors and peers) both sides
                            agreed not to include color at this stage as we need to find core issues plaguing our
                            application design.

                            User testing revealed a few weak points. Users could not immediately
                            navigate back to their previous page, there was a learning curve for
                            deleting and adding items, and the buttons were not obvious.

                            In order to resolve these issues and confusion that our users had
                            experienced with our low-fidelity prototype we had to meet all the
                            design requirements and how it was solved below:

                            When we began this project, our aim was to tackle food waste. Initially, we were
                            eager to pack our product with as many features as possible. However, through
                            research, user feedback, and continuous refinement, we learned that a simpler
                            approach, focused on what users truly needed, was more effective.
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            If we had more time, we would deepen our exploration into user experience.
                            Specifically, we aim to gain a better understanding of the interaction between
                            users and the FridgeMinder camera and digital display. This insight would be crucial
                            for identifying necessary adjustments and enhancements.
