                            A 10-week project that dived into the visual systems for a music
                            festival held at the University of Washington. This festival was a
                            farmers market with a theme of romanticism; these values were
                            incorporated throughout the design.

                        <p>
                            As I worked on my final word mark I considered the feeling
                            my wordmark would convey. In order to make this easier I had
                            some requirements the font had to meet:
                        </p>
                        <!-- LIST -->
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                            <li>A feeling of comfort and warmth.</li>
                            <li>A close relationship with the word “Love.”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Finding a font that reflects my requirements was difficult.
                            I had to spend hours searching for the perfect one. I eventually
                            stumbled upon a font called “Tapestry”. This font features sharp
                            edges that reminded me of the sharpness that can be found on rose petals.
                            This immediately made me associate the font with the word “Love”.
                            Additionally to emphasize the feeling of warmth and comfort I decided
                            to use tracking to have individual characters closer.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my iteration I also worked on finding a way to
                            associate the word mark via an analogy. I did this by making the
                            ‘O’ in the word ‘LOVE’ a rose. Since roses are deeply associated with
                            love I felt it was appropriate to incorporate it. However, after going
                            through several rounds of critique I found the rose was overwhelming and
                            distracting. Instead, the rose would be later used in other areas of the
                            design.

                        <p>
                           In order to craft my color palette I thought deeply about the
                            setting and emotions I want my visitors to feel through my design.
                            I knew my farmers market was going to be held at night so I wanted to
                            showcase colors that would also convey small details such as night skies
                            and the moonlight. However, I also wanted to add elements that evoked the
                            feeling of love. The first thing that came to mind was the color pink.
                        </p>

                            <b> Conflict of Color Selection:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was a bit worried that this was not going to work as I had to try a lot of
                            different pink variations to satisfy the WCAG color contrast. I eventually
                            found the right colors but had to be very careful when using it later in
                            my design.

                        <p>
                            To make my poster much more eye-catching and interesting I tried to play
                            with different types of organization to create hierarchy in my design.
                            However, after receiving feedback, I recognized that my initial approach
                            made it hard to read key information, such as the event name, lineup date,
                            and lineup details. This is when I learned that fun design isn't always great.
                            It might look interesting but sometimes it might not be effective.
                            In order to fix this issue I decided to create a much more simple design
                            that follows a column layout. This helped fix the issues with readability
                            and it created more harmony.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After deciding my structure I started to play around with color and fun elements,
                            such as my rose that did not work out in my word mark. For the poster I decided to
                            use the rose to reflect the moon in a dark blue sky with small circle stars.
                            All these elements were carefully chosen to reflect the night setting and romantic
                            atmosphere of my festival.

                        <p>
                            I wanted to create a ticket that would fit into someone's wallet.
                            In order to accomplish this I first tried to design a ticket using a
                            business card dimensions (3.5 in X 2 in) but after going through critique
                            rounds I realized that not all business cards fit into every wallet.
                            Additionally I also felt that my design was overly crowded. This causes readability
                            issues for both festival staff and attendees. After taking all these considerations
                            into mind, I redesigned my ticket. First I changed the frame size I was working
                            on by using a universal credit card dimension (2.125 in X 3.37 in). Additionally
                            I also worked on designing both the front and back card utilizing the space
                            more thoughtfully. My intent was to use the front side of the card specifically
                            as a memorable keepsake for attendees while the back side specifically for
                            festival staff to have an easy time to check attendees into the event.

                           While creating my mobile design I aimed to create clear separations between
                            pieces of information to avoid a cluttered appearance. To establish a visual
                            hierarchy, I utilized varying letter spacings and font styles to highlight key
                            elements of the application. Additionally, I incorporated rounded corners in the
                            card design for consistency throughout the user interface. Finally, I included icons
                            across the app to enhance visual appeal and improve user engagement. I presented my
                            first design iteration for critique and got one main issue on the payment and student icon.
                            Many said that the icons were inconsistent between thickness and overall width.
                            However, they enjoyed having the icons as they felt they gave a more friendly look.
                            In order to fix these issues I started to search for different icons that could fit in.
                            In particular, I payed close attention to icon line width and overall width so it can
                            be more consistent.

                            During user testing, participants indicated that the payment screen was
                            somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the student discount section.
                            Feedback highlighted that the wording was unclear and lacked a description of
                            the user actions required. In response, I revised the text and added a brief
                            explanatory note under the discount to clarify the information users would need to
                            provide. Additionally, I received critiques regarding the icons; some appeared
                            inconsistent in thickness. To address this, I adjusted several icons to enhance
                            uniformity across the interface.

                            This project was challenging as it was my first time trying to design all
                            elements of an event. The hardest part of the design was creating the poster.
                            I felt that I wanted to create a striking poster design but found out that this
                            was not the correct thinking as it only created lots of readability issues.
                            Although I had a lot of ups and downs creating this work, I realized how small
                            details can make a huge difference into how design is viewed or used.
                            Had I had more time to work on this project I would have liked to explore
                            incorporating dark. This would be a good challenge as the dark theme would
                            force me to think deeply about maintaining the brand layout and also create
                            new harmonies with the existing visual design.
