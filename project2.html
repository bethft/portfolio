                        <p>Eat Together! It is a student-to-student start-up aimed to match students,
                            rather than using a swipe method it matches students based on similar
                            interests/hobbies and schedules. The app aims to get students to eat a meal
                            together to create new friendships. Students can select events listed that
                            have been posted by the event holder and can decide whether they would like
                            to join based on the time availability and restaurant location.

                            that can create a bond with new acquaintances.

                            peers during events. Presently, the app solely facilitates event creation and
                            sign-ups. With this new feature, students can dine together and also
                            participate in engaging questions!

                        <p>Prior to starting the game, users will receive a brief written guideline to familiarize new users with the new feature. We've incorporated a timer to create a sense of urgency in selecting answers, enhancing excitement. If users require more time, the event holder can extend the timer by 30 seconds. Additionally, we've included a feature that displays the number of users who have responded to each question.

                            Once users are ready to begin the game, the screen will present the question along with two options, allowing users to choose the one they resonate with the most. Upon completing their selection, they will be seamlessly directed to a waiting screen, where they can actively monitor the number of participants in the event who have yet to respond.

                        <p>During user testing, we found that certain features lacked clarity. Users reported that the "add time" feature in the game had no visible countdown, making it difficult for them to gauge the remaining time accurately. Additionally, users found the "add time" prompt unclear, questioning the duration of time added. The initial screen did present the prompt in a clear enough manner. Users often overlooked the feature guidelines, leading to confusion.

                            Users expressed a desire to see the total number of questions in the game and track their progress. They reported confusion and difficulty in finding an exit option when they wanted to stop playing. Additionally, users were unsure if their responses were successfully submitted and wished to have visibility on the remaining time before the next question.

                            <p>Throughout this project, I gained invaluable experience collaborating with individuals from diverse academic backgrounds, each bringing a unique approach to design. This experience has significantly enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively within a team. I was surprised by the pace at which we had to develop the UX/UI content, which initially felt rushed. However, I quickly adapted to meet the company's deadlines and requirements, realizing my capacity to thrive under pressure and accommodate organizational needs efficiently.  If I were to redo this project I would aim to incorporate more user testing into our design process to ensure a stronger final product. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented us from conducting more extensive user testing in this project. Working with developers, project managers and other UX designers was rewarding, and I look forward to similar opportunities in the future.
